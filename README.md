## üìñ About

Gothic Multiplayer is a fan-made multiplayer modification for Gothic 2: Night of the Raven that allows players to experience the world of Gothic together. Originally released in January 2011, this project has been improved with various fixes and enhancements since 2022, but the majority of its code is still quite dated.

> **Historical Note**: To see the code close to its original 2011/2012 release state, check out the [v0.2b tagged version](https://github.com/Pinemarten/GothicMultiplayer/tree/v0.2b).
